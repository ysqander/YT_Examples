15011,France,"Crisp, mineral and tight, this is still a young bottling. It is dry, full of citrus-fruit flavors and with a fine burst of acidity that cuts through the wine. Let this delicious wine settle for a few more months to add more fruit to the texture.

106349,France,"The oak aging, implicit in the name of the wine, is present in its smooth character.

43972,France,"Like many Beaujolais in 2010, this wine has a firm and tannic structure. Being Morgon, though, it also has power and richness, the black fruits intense, with acidity to balance.

The rest is Grenache, and in 2009 the result is slightly pruny, with touches of coffee, chocolate and Christmas spice. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without being soft, thanks to the crisp acids and silky tannins on the finish.
